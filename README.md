JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic scripting language primarily used for adding interactivity to web pages. It runs in the browser and allows developers to manipulate HTML and CSS through the DOM (Document Object Model). JavaScript supports multiple programming paradigms like object-oriented, functional, and event-driven programming. Modern JavaScript (ES6+) includes features like arrow functions, promises, async/await, and modules. It's also used on the server-side through Node.js, making it a full-stack development language. JavaScript plays a key role in building responsive web applications and powering popular frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.
